        <p>The Data Crystal Garden. GRA Graduation exhibit. 2024.
You are looking at a garden of data crystals. They have all processed “radical” data, been used for hacking or had Pegasus on
them. Pegasus is an advanced survallience bug used by many governments. In the ethereal landscapes of digital existence,
memory takes on multifaceted forms, residing within the confines of hard drives and the transient spaces of RAM.
Minerals, ancient and timeless, find new purpose as they crystallize around the computers bodies —a reflection of the social and
political fabric interwoven with our virtual interactions. In neo spiritualism crystals are often heralded as conductors of energy, if
this is the case my data crystal garden is growing red politics. As all the computer parts given to me by
my community holds their red data. Hard drives become vessels for ideologies, storing not just data but the resistance of their
actions and research. However, as computers transcend their utilitarian origins, they ensnare us in a tech feudalism,
monopolizing our lives. Yet, amids this digital dominion, rebellion takes form—a defiance encapsulated in the freezing of
memories within crystals, nature reclaims. Here, the computers used body grows as a relic of resistance, a testament to the
struggle against ephemeral yet traceable dangers lurking. the digital landscape- my crystal garden where memory intertwines
with activism, art, and magik, forging a new narrative of resistance in the age of technology. Here, within the
crystalline depths of data, lies the essence of our digital existence- we cannot deny the physicality of our overlords.
Go a bit closer put your ear to the wall and listen to the soundpiece.
The sound piece is an epic poem in line with oral traditions, it tells the story of a hero who faces obstacles. The Pegasus is his
opponent alongside with the people who's faces are captured by the screens. His thoughts and actions are ingulfed and grows in
this crystal garden, alongside other rebels..
Made from Copper, donated computers, radical data, sillica crystals, Epsom, water, glass, will power, poetry, community, wool,
concrete and zink.
